Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these stores, but not on their ratio.  The pattern of dissolved P concentrations is explained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the dissolved P store (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air dryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy limitation). This gives a pattern of P concentration in soil water that decreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-arid tropical environments.

Soil nutrient outputs of the BiosEquil model
Nutrient status is one of the key limiting factors determining the productivity of Australian vegetation systems, but is only broadly represented by gross nutrient status an attribute compiled from the Atlas of Australian Soils (McKenzie et al. 2000).

The 0.05° gridded data were resampled to 0.01° using the cubic algorithm with RESAMPLE in ARCINFO GRID.

The pattern of mineral N concentrations is explained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N store (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air dryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy limitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that decreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-arid tropical environments.

Soil nutrient outputs of the BiosEquil model
Nutrient status is one of the key limiting factors determining the productivity of Australian vegetation systems, but is only broadly represented by gross nutrient status an attribute compiled from the Atlas of Australian Soils (McKenzie et al. 2000).

The area selected does not include Australias marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.

This report details the datasets and procedures used to produce the 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia. As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 decimal degree (dd) resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd NZ topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).', true, 'Bathymetry and Topography 9 sec', 'http://spatial.ala.org.au/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=ALA:bath_topo_ausbath_09_v4&format=image/png&styles=', NULL, '', '', '', NULL, 'http://www.ga.gov.au/meta/ANZCW0703013116.html', 'Topography', NULL, '848', '2010-01', '2009', 'eng', NULL, 'custodian', 3, 'https://www.ga.gov.au/gadds/licences/licence_1.html', NULL, 'http://www.ga.gov.au/marine/bathymetry.jsp');
